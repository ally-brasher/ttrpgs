         <p>Monster of the Week (MOTW) is a game in the Powered by the Apocalypse system. The game master is called the Keeper. It is inspired by the tv genre by the same name where there is a cohesive plot but there is a new threat every week for the characters to face. The game is typically run in "mysyeries" where a story arc is based on a specific threat.</p>
        <p>Of the systems on this website, it is has the simplest rules. There are set player moves that keep the rules simple for players so they can focus on the story.</p>
